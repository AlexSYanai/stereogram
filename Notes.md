# Review

## Overall

Solid startup, pretty interface, seems like a promising app.

## Tests

I kiss you.

## Migrations

Constrained, defined and you use migrations to alter the schema like you ought.
I kiss you again.

## Dat App

Really nice.  Really, really nice.

## Also

Remove turbolinks...it may be causing your JS issues.
